# Reactive Programming for the Rest of Us at Code on the Sea 2015

This is the repository for the presentation "Reactive Programming for the Rest of Us" at [Code on the Sea 2014](http://www.codeonthesea.com/).

## Outline
Reactive Programming has been a hot topic as of late, with such things as the Coursera Course taught by Martin Odersky and Erik Meijer, as well as the Reactive Manfiesto (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/). We see many frameworks such as FlapJax, RxJS, Bacon.JS for middleware, and then on the front end, we start to see UI frameworks such as ReactJS from Facebook, Angular, and Elm. This word Reactive becomes very confusing as it quickly loses its meaning. What exactly does Reactive mean? A simple definition of Reacting to input, events, load, etc is not enough. In this talk, we'll explore some of the basics of Reactive Programming, and explore all the frameworks and languages and how they really are the future of web development.
